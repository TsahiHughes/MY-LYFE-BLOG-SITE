      <h3><b>Freshman Year</b></h3>
      <h5>Orientation, <span class="w3-opacity">May 14, 2018</span></h5>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>Freshman orientation to some can be seen as a very scary thing, if you are quite reserved it can feel like your being pried out of your shell and forced to communicate but if your like me who is quite a social butterfly you blend right in with the social crowd. When arriving to orientation you are seperated from your parents and put in groups and led by tour guides to explore the campus and open up to eachother. Those in your group are the first people you will be interacting with, so they are litterally your day one's right there. I was put in a pretty quiet group but my group leader was the best, Shout Out (uncle) KYLE!!, long story of why I call him uncle, only he knows why... Through out your day you should have a new squad by now, for me I made many friends most in which im still friends with and I am now in my freshman year. We have group chats and messages and social media that we all still communicate in and even hang out when we are free, thats the key to college make friends and network then can you learn to better yourself and those around you. Later in closing you get to the part you mainly came for PICKING YOUR CLASSES!!. This was the most stressful part of the day for those who were undeclared. the best thing you can do when entering college is come into the univesity with you mind made set on what you would like to major in or  have a few on mind this way you can simply pick and go home. You may be timed to pick classes as I was and that stressed me more out, these are just some personal tips to make you college entrance more accessible and easy. College can be tough to start out as you have so many nerves rushing through your body and you dont really know what to expect the best thing you can do is go with the flow but most importantly be yourself, nothing can go wrong as long as you open yourself up to oppurtunity and you try your best. How did college orientation go for you guys feel free to share your experiences with me in the comments I would love to hear all about it :). Untill next time my lovelies, Subscribe to be notified when i post!! . </p>

      <h3><b>Midterm Crisis</b></h3>
      <h5> Some tips on How to Survive your Midterms <span class="w3-opacity">October 21, 2018/span></h5>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>      <p>During Midterm season life can litterally suck. The campus seems as if everyone in moving in slow motion and as if time has simpliy came at a stand still. Those in passing might seem stressed and the whole campus might seem as if they are all smokers. This all comes from the stress of the the season. During midterms the best option for you to relieve your stress is to eventually achieve the midset of being satisfied with your results and accepting the enevitable. Most people me included tend to not do so good on the first midterm of rhe semester if you can relate try not to stress as that eas only the first test. you will be fine ass you now know what to further expect and can take time to better prepare yourself and achieve better study habits. I know for me I was super stressed and i had tension heaadache and mgranes and was simply driving myself insane wracking my mind with solutions of how I was gonn raise my grade, you may feel this way aswell just know that whatever result you got is what it is and you tried you best and sometimes you have to take an L in order learn from it and get ahead. You also might feel like your professor simply hates you as the question you studied are not even feautured on the test and some might contaplate dropping out every minitue of the day. Trust me I have surely experienced these same feelings as you and believe me when I say life may suck now but you will be okay !!!</p>

      <h4><b>Tsahi Hughes ( SJSU Sophmore)</b></h4>
      <p>Just me, myself and my random thoughts and ideas meant to inspire and hopefully help someones through out their day. I love to talk about real life experiences as most like to post only the highlights of their college experience and never the bad, I feel how can one simply learn to over come the bad parts if they are only prone to read about the good. I do these blogs so I can simply tll my story and I also use it as a since on theraputic diary that I present to the public to entertain and hopefully relate. I hope you enjoy my blog and feel free to comment and tell me some things you want me to talk about or som discussions you would like to have, Untill next time my Lovelies... </p>
